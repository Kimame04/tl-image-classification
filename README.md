# tl-image-classification

Image classification project through transfer learning, in the Singapore context.

This project aims to classify land use images and therefore identify land use features in Singapore. The analysis of this land use data would be useful for future landscaping on construction projects.

The dataset can be found [here](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html), and the Google Colab notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uCVFkeyRcSy113eppH3J8oDdDPFBgNg4?usp=sharing).
