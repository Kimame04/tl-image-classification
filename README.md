# tl-image-classification

The aim of this project is to be able to perform image classification on land use features through transfer learning.

The dataset can be found [here](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html).

## Changelog (YY/mm/dd)

### 2021/08/10

- Decided to go with sampling images from a Folium map. These images would be useful especially if we were to conduct the classification in the Singapore context.
- Test accuracy stands at about 89% which is close to the validation accuracy 
- Added the dataset folder to the repository.

### 2021/07/11

- Added saved model (~90% accuracy)

### 2021/07/08
